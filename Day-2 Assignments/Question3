Similarity between an array name and a pointer variable - 
1. An array name and a pointer variable are similar in case as per the way they access the memory.
2. We can get the elements of array and pointer using the name.

Diffrence between an array name and a pointer variable - 
1. A pointer variable can take different addresses as value whereas, in case of array it is fixed.
2. A pointer is a place in memory that keeps address of another place inside whereas an array is a single, pre allocated chunk of
   contiguous elements, fixed in size and location.
3. A pointer allows us to indirectly access variables through addresses and not values. Array allows us to access through values
   i.e.a[4] refers to the 5th element of the array.
4. Pointer can’t be initialized at definition. Array can be initialized at definition.
