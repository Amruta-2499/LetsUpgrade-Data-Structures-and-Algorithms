
In the Binary Search algorithm, it is suggested to calculate the mid as beg+(end-beg)/2 instead of (beg+end)/2;
becasuse-

1. If beg and end have value equal to maximum integer value then it will cause integer overflow, so this can be avoided 
   by calculating mid using beg+(end-beg)/2.
   
2. If the values of beg and end are less than 0(zero) then it will result in segmentation fault because of invalid index.
